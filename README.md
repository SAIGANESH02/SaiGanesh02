## (Computer) Vision with Lost Glasses 
### Modelling how the brain deals with noisy input

Imagine you lost your spectacle and the world around you is completely blurred out. As you stumble around, you see a small animal walk towards you. Can you figure out what it is? Probably yes right? In this situation, or in foggy/night-time conditions, visual input is of poor quality; images are blurred and have low contrast and yet our brains manage to recognize it. Is it possible to model the process? Does previous experience help?

## Predicting the decision based on BFC
### Maintaining the Brain Functional Connectivity (BFC) in the gambling task using the HCP fMRI data-set.

Are there any regions and networks in the brain which are more affected by the Win and Loss Event conditions corresponding to someoneâ€™s decision? To analyze data-set being preprocessed by HCPÂ© for NMA-2021 that they recorded using fMRI is to analyze in this project to maintain connectivity and correlation of the areas which are involved in the task.

## DeepFakes Generation Using Deep Learning
### DeepFakes Generation Techniques for Face Forensics Using Deep Learning DCGAN model

Deep fakes are a machine learning approach in which a personâ€™s resemblance is changed in an existing image or video. Deep fakes have become a social problem since they allow anyoneâ€™s image to be co-opted, putting our ability to believe what we see into question. We create a GAN to generate deepfakes in this project.

## Time Series Forecasting based on Ethereum Prices
### Time Series Forecasting based on Ethereum Cryptocurrency Stock prices data with different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models
A machine learning-based time series analysis was used to anticipate the market price and stability of Ethereum in the Crypto-market. Time-series analysis can forecast future price fluctuations in Ethereum. For time series analysis, we employed LSTM, moving averages, ARIMA, and FBProphet as machine learning approaches.

## Super Mario Playing Agent Using RL
### Super Mario Playing Agent using Double DQN Reinforcement learning method

In this project, we use the PyTorch library to create the Reinforcement Learning method using the Deep Double Q-Network (DDQN) algorithms. We demonstrate how the recently developed Double Q learning (DQN) technique, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, may be utilised to create an agent that assists in completing levels in Super Mario Bros.

## Speech recognition with HMM
### Speech Word-Recognition with Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
The speech recognition system implemented during this project trains one hidden Markov model for each word that it should be able to recognize. The models are trained with labeled training data, and the classification is performed by passing the features to each model and then selecting the best match.

## ChatZ
### An Ethereum-powered Decentralized chat application.
With the persisting scenario of increased privacy and security breaches in chatting and social media platforms, thereâ€™s been a sense of insecurity stirring amongst people globally. Decentralized applications use peer-to-peer networks, this eliminates the possibility of network failure due to central node failure. Blockchain functions as an immutable ledger that allows for decentralized messaging.

## VIRTUAL-TV
### Capture a video of a TV frame and inlay a video to fit this frame
In this project the basic aim was to try and fit in the overlay of a subject video onto another video containing the respective frame for playing the latter subject video. The solution to this problem was achieved by making the user define the four corners of the frame and then the previously mentioned corners using the Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow function in OpenCV were being kept track of.
